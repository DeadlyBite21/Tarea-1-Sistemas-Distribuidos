4,What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree?,,"One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\n\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \n\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought."

2,Do animals have a sense of humour?,"As an example, would a dog dig up another dog's bone and bury it elsewhere as a joke?","Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\n\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way."

7,How do I take photos for e-commerce ?,I need to take photos for my online store.  Any ideas?  How do I create a transparent background?,You need 2 lights to get contrast.  Set one at 10 O'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  Put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  Use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in Photoshop to delete out the background.  Support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  Keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  That's about it!
10,What is the U.S. Green card procedure after labor certificate approval and how much time it will take?,,"This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready."

If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed. So find out what your guy is into (maybe a sports team, hobby, character, etc) and go with that. If it's what he's intrested in, you can't go wrong no matter what you think of it."

Doesn't it end up keeping people away from your website since they simply subscribe to your data and don't have any reason to visit?\n\nYes it's good that people are reading your data (blogs, etc.) but your hits go down and ad revenue dwindles if people stop coming.\n\nIsn't that what a commecial site owner would be thinking about RSS?","Yes, and some sites provide ""partial"" feeds via RSS, requiring the user to go to the site before being able to read all the data.\n\nThe argument for full feeds more or less runs like this:  You need to entice users to your site.  By providing a full feed you are giving your users what they want, and they will be more inclined to look upon you favorably.  So rather than directly forcing eyeballs to your site, you are working on the reputation of your site for quality data, and hoping the users will pass along your site to others through bloglines or deli.cio.us, and getting new  eyeballs indirectly."

3,What's the best way to fight a cold?,,"Seasonal Defense (90) \nPowerful Immune Support\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription: Seasonal changes can be quite stressful to the body. That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066\n\n\nI definitely stand by this stuff!!!!!

2,What color is water really?,"Obviously, it would seem as if pure water is transparent, but I read somewhere that water actually has a very slight blueish tint.  I think this may have something to do with the light being bent as it passes through or something.  Sometimes you can even see a blueish color.  For example, when you fill up your bathtub several inches, you can see a slight blueish color.  Also, lakes and the ocean can appear blueish, even when the sky is not a blue color to reflect.","The absorption minimum for water is at 420 nm, well within the blue range of the visual spectrum. This means that that is the wavelength of light that it reflects the most. It does not reflect it very much, so small amounts appear transparent."

1,Who are kurds?,,"Kurds (kûrds, kʊrds) , a non-Arab Middle Eastern minority population that inhabits the region known as Kurdistan, an extensive plateau and mountain area in SW Asia (c.74,000 sq mi/191,660 sq km), including parts of E Turkey, NE Iraq, and NW Iran and smaller sections of NE Syria and Armenia. The region lies astride the Zagros Mts. (Iran) and the eastern extension of the Taurus Mts. (Turkey) and extends in the south across the Mesopotamian plain and includes the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nAs of the late 1990s, there were estimated to be more than 20 million Kurds, about half of them in Turkey, where, making up more than 20% of the population, they dwell near the Iranian frontier around Lake Van, as well as in the vicinity of Diyarbakir and Erzurum. The Kurds in Iran, who constitute some 10% of its people, live principally in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, with some in Fars. The Iraqi Kurds, about 23% of its population, live mostly in the vicinity of Dahuk (Dohuk), Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Sulaimaniyah.\n\nEthnically close to the Iranians, the Kurds were traditionally nomadic herders but are now mostly seminomadic or sedentary. The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Kurdish dialects belong to the northwestern branch of the Iranian languages. The Kurds have traditionally resisted subjugation by other nations. Despite their lack of political unity throughout history, the Kurds, as individuals and in small groups, have had a lasting impact on developments in SW Asia. Saladin, who gained fame during the Crusades, is perhaps the most famous of all Kurds."

Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply."

2,is gas milage better in cold weather.does gas expand giving you more.?,,"Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \n\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\n\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is."
2,why the sky is blue?,,"The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue."

He said once you start serving, you won't want to be served again.\n\nAnother great teacher on vision and leadership is John Maxwell.

The standee prop was created as part of a story line involving a dog food commercial in which Danson's character (an actor) appears, but references to the figure were cut from the finished version of the film.""\n\n""(The standee shows up once more in the film: Ted Danson is standing next to it when the baby's mother comes to reclaim her child.) The figure was accidentally left in front of a window on the set by a propman and thereby ""sneaked"" into the background of one scene. Additionally, all indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto soundstage -- no real structures were used for interior filming."""

2,Is space infinite?,,"Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space ""\n\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \n\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \n\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \n\nA period or interval of time. \nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers.""\n\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond ""No"".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that ""things"" and ""existence"" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, ""Infinity is all unthings non-existing"".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite."

5,what type of web site content should be included in a web site?,,"Noticed he said CONTENT.  Content is information aside from the website design and layout.\n\nContent on a website is best unique, as opposed to syndicated (taken from someone else).\n\nIf your site is uniquely written, that's good.  If it's well written, that's great.\n\nIf your site is writing about an interesting topic, uniquely written by you, and well-written, that's awesome -- That's the premisis for creating content for a good website.\n\nAlso, content can come in forms of raw data -- Like, if you wanted to make a travel site -- you can list the prices it takes to fly from Chicago to Pittsburg.  Or you can have a currency converter.\n\nAnother thing you can incorporate is a chatroom or message board for users to discuss the content and post their suggestions."
